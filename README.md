# terraform-aws-elasticsearch-cloudwatch-sns-alarms

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dubiety/terraform-aws-elasticsearch-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dubiety/terraform-aws-elasticsearch-cloudwatch-sns-alarms)
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/dubiety/terraform-aws-elasticsearch-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.svg)](https://github.com/dubiety/terraform-aws-elasticsearch-cloudwatch-sns-alarms/releases)

Terraform module that configures the [recommended Amazon ElasticSearch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-alarms.html) using CloudWatch and sends alerts to an SNS topic.  By default, this module creates an SNS topic, but it can be configured to point to an existing SNS topic (see [example](./examples/use-existing-sns/main.tf))

`v1.x` supports terraform `v0.12` syntax!

## Metrics and Alarms

| area       | metric                    | operator | threshold | rationale                                                                                                                              |
|------------|---------------------------|----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sharding   | ClusterStatus.red         | `>=`     | 1         | At least one primary shard and its replicas are not allocated to a node                                                                |
| Sharding   | ClusterStatus.yellow      | `>=`     | 1         | At least one replica shard is not allocated to a node                                                                                  |
| Storage    | FreeStorageSpace          | `<=`     | 20480 MB  | A node in your cluster is down to low storage space.                                                                                   |
| Storage    | ClusterIndexWritesBlocked | `>=`     | 1         | Your cluster is blocking write requests.                                                                                               |
| Node Count | Nodes                     | `<`      | `x`       | This alarm indicates that at least one node in your cluster has been unreachable for one day                                           |
| Snapshot   | AutomatedSnapshotFailure  | `>=`     | 1         | An automated snapshot failed. This failure is often the result of a red cluster health status.                                         |
| CPU        | CPUUtilization            | `>=`     | 80 %      | 100% CPU utilization isn't uncommon, but sustained high usage is problematic. Consider using larger instance types or more instances.  |
| Memory     | JVMMemoryPressure         | `>=`     | 80 %      | The cluster could encounter out of memory errors if usage increases. Consider scaling vertically.                                      |
| CPU        | MasterCPUUtilization      | `>=`     | 80 %      | Consider using larger instance types for your dedicated master nodes.                                                                  |
| Memory     | MasterJVMMemoryPressure   | `>=`     | 80 %      | Consider using larger instance types for your dedicated master nodes.                                                                  |
| KMS        | KMSKeyError               | `>=`     | 1         | The KMS encryption key that is used to encrypt data at rest in your domain is disabled. Re-enable it to restore normal operations      |
| Memory     | KMSKeyInaccessible        | `>=`     | 80 %      | The KMS encryption key that is used to encrypt data at rest in your domain has been deleted or has revoked its grants to Amazon ES     |

## Examples

See the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for working examples.

```hcl
resource "aws_elasticsearch_domain" "es" {
  domain_name           = "example"
  elasticsearch_version = "6.3"

  cluster_config {
    instance_type = "r4.large.elasticsearch"
  }

  snapshot_options {
    automated_snapshot_start_hour = 23
  }

  tags = {
    Domain = "TestDomain"
  }
}

module "es_alarms" {
  source         = "github::https://github.com/dubiety/terraform-aws-elasticsearch-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  domain_name    = "example"
  tags = {
    Domain = "TestDomain"
  }
}
```

You can alternatively have this module not create an SNS incase you have existing ones created elsewhere.

```hcl
module "es_alarms" {
  source           = "github::https://github.com/dubiety/terraform-aws-elasticsearch-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  domain_name      = "example"
  sns_topic        = "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456123456:sns-to-slack"   # < Put your full SNS ARN here, if necessary read from var or a resource
  create_sns_topic = false
  tags = {
    Domain = "TestDomain"
  }
}
```
